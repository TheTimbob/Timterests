Personal blog to cover topics that I am interested in.

## Installation
### Docker
If you have docker installed, all you need to do is run:
'''console
docker compose up
'''

### Local
Ensure you have Go installed.
<https://go.dev/doc/install>

Once Go is istalled, install templ for templating:
'''console
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
'''
